# Coupling Flux Balance Analysis with Reactive Transport Modeling through Machine Learning

## Release Notes
A repository for the paper entitled ``Coupling Flux Balance Analysis with Reactive Transport Modeling through Machine Learning for Rapid and Stable Simulation of Microbial Metabolic Switching`` currently in review. We developed ANNs as a surrogate model for FBA for the integration with reactive-transport models. The peformance of the proposed method was evaluated through the case study of simulating dynamic metabolic switching of _Shewanella oneidensis_ MR-1 in 0-dimenstional batch and 1-dimentional column reactors, resepctively. 

## System requirements
Matlab R2015b+ in Windows 

## Basic requirements for implementation
- Install the COBRA Toolbox (https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/index.html)
- Put all files in the same folder, including: (1) iMR799_atp40.mat, (2) minimalMedia_noCarbon.xlsx, and (3) runMetabolicSwitching.m
